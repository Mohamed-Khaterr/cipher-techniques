# Cipher Techniques

### Classical Encryption Techniques:
There are two basic building blocks of all Encryption Techniques: Substitution and
Transposition

------------


- #### Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. Its simply a type of substitution cipher, each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

	- Encrypt
	- Decrypt

------------


- #### Poly Alphabetic Cipher
 Poly Alphabetic Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table.

	- Encrypt
	- Decrypt

- #### Columnar Transposition Cipher
The Columnar Transposition Cipher is a form of transposition cipher just like Rail Fence Cipher. Columnar Transposition involves writing the plaintext out in rows, and then reading the ciphertext off in columns one by one.
